- index.htnml is the root webpage, as the source for github pages for this repo is set to "docs"
- This readme.md will not show up as root because of .nojekyll file in this directory.
- We can see readme.md if we type "readme.md" at the root of the weblink in the browser
- Any files or folders above the "docs" folder will not be accessible through the github-pages.
-  Folders under this folder will be available.
